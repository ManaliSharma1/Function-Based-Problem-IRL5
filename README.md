## Assignment 5: Real-World Function-Based Systems

## About This Assignment

This project presents Python-based solutions to real-world inspired scenarios using structured programming techniques.

The implementation emphasizes:
- Function-driven design
- Logical decision making
- Iterative processing
- Data handling using lists and sets
- Mathematical computation
- Practical validation rules

Each module reflects how Python logic is applied in real industry environments.
